This challenge was a bit difficult for me but I did it within 3 days and completed it before the due date. 
The git pull, git commit, git etc. commands, I have to get use to. Atleast I now know |git add 'x'| basically marks the file/folder(?) as "READY TO BE COMMIT", which     then means I have to write a commit (in Orange) to make it ready to be PUSHED as |git push| with pushed all commit changes to the repository in Git Hub

List of things learned/solved:
  1. I learned how to to 'and' for conditional 'if'
  2. When outputing results into .txt file, adding a delimiter will put a delimiter AFTER EVERY OTHER LETTER, so I put the results in brackets 
    to combine the line as lists so they dont have a delimiter breaking the quotes.
  3. I do not need to add a os.path.join for the txt file, just the path itself (as long as its within the same repository)
  4. "Summary Commands" of a list can be saved as variables 
      ex: max_value = max(pfChange)
  5. If an import is not lit up, it means that imported def is not in use and can delete import if it's not used at all.
